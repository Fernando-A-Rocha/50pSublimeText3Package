# 50p Sublime Text 3 Package

This is 50p's Sublime 3 Package that adds snippets for Multi Theft Auto functions. The package was originally made by him, I've just updated it.

I've updated his package to include the current changes up to MTA version 1.5.1 (as of 2/12/2015, 2nd of December, 2015)

I'm also thinking of adding Useful functions as well, however my knowledge of Sublime packages is limited and the way I have it right now works, but is a bit of a pain as it just adds the existing code above where ever your adding the function. If anybody wants to add a way themselves or wants to contact me to help me, feel free to!

Any spelling mistakes or any issues, please contact me!

Thanks!
