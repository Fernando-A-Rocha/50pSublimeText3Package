# 50p Sublime Text 3 Package

This is 50p's Sublime 3 Package that adds snippets for Multi Theft Auto functions. The package was originally made by him, I've just updated it.

I've updated his package to include the current changes up to MTA version 1.5.1 (as of 2/12/2015, 2nd of December, 2015)

Any spelling mistakes or any issues, please contact me!

Thanks!

## Current todo list:
 - Add event handlers (just search like "onClientClick", then add the whole event handler to where ever you type. E.g. addEventHandler("onClientClick", element theElement, function functionName))
 - Add useful functions (still searching a good way to do this, however I have a working version, but its not very good)
